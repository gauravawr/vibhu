3.1.4 Sorting algorithms

Merge Sorting: divide the array recursively and until single elements then keep merging into 2 pairs and sort then 4 ... when merge 2 pairs then need to go through in for loop for each element
Bubble Sorting: go through all no's one by one in two for loops


3.1.3 Searching algorithms

Linear Searching: go through one by one
Binary Searching: sort first, then divide the list into two and see if it > or < than the middle no
